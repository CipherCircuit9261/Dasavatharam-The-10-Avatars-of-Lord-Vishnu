 In Hinduism Vishnu posseses four symbols on his four hands.They are the discus Chakratazhwar Chakra, the bow Sharanga, the mace Kaumodaki, the conch Panchajanya, and the sword Nandaka. His most powerful and recognisable weapons is the Chakratazhwar Chakaram. However, in actuality this chakram is Chakrathazhwar, also known as Chakratazhwar Perumal. He emerges as the divine embodiment of Vishnu's most potent weapon the sudharshana chakram, signifying the guide to enlightenment. Found in dedicated shrines across Vishnu-associated temples, Chakrathazhwar is believed to embody the combined grace of Varaha and Narasimha. Chakrathazhwar is one among the nithya sooriyas who perform kainkaryam to the divya dampathis for eternity. Chakratazhwar has appeared countless times throughout the four yugas. During Krita Yuga he apeeread five times with Vishnu's four avatars Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Narashima.With Matsya he appeared in Matsya's Horn which aided in pulling the ship created by Sage Vaivasvata Manu when pralayam occured. When Vishnu incarnated as Kurma Avatar Chakratazhwar appeared two times. The first time was during the churning of the ocean. When the Asuras and Devas were churning the ocean with the mountain. Vishnu became the Kurma Avatar to stabilize the mountain for proper churning. However, it doesn't there Chakratazwhar as the Chakratazhwar Chakra was above kurma Avatar osciliating left and right like a cast cutter. Due to this constant left and right motion The Churning was easier for The Asuras and Devas to conduct. After the churning was over, The Amrutha(Nectar) of Immortality was finally made, but there was a problem. The Asuras wanted this Amrutha(Nectar) all to themselves to overthrow the Devas. Therefore Vishnu(still as Kurma) became Mohini avatar and started to give out the Amrutha(Nectar) to the devas who were silently devoted themselves to Vishnu and manipulated the Asuras that Vishnu will give it, but in actuality wasn't. One of the Asuras Svarbhanu disguised himself as a deva. The Devas surronding Svarbhanu discoverd this and informed this to Lord Vishnu. However, Svarbhanu had already drank the amurtham making him immortal. Therefore Vishnu(as Mohini) cut Svarbhanu's head with his Chakratazhwar Chakra. Later Svarbhanu's head was referred to as Rahu whilst his body was referred to as Ketu. When Vishnu becaame Lord Shri Lakshmi Narashima. Chakratazwar was in his claws. This is because these were the same claws used to kill Hiranyakshipu. In Treta Yuga There were three instances where Chakratazhwar appeared. With Vamana, Parashurama and Rama.  Vamana while visiting King Bali(The Grandson of Prahalda) who was doing Achamanam asked for three pieces of land. While Hearing this King Bali was attempting to pour water from his patram but not matter what he did the water was blocked. What happened was Shukracharya shrunk to block the spout of the patram because he early had warned King Bali about How Vamana posed a threat to him and his kingdom. In effort to stop him from continuing his pooja Shukracharya blocked the spout. However, Vamana said that something was block the spout and used his grass ring to push into the spuout to get Shukracharya out of there. In this instance the Chakratazhwar Chakra was a the tip of the grass leaf and since it was their both of Shukracharya eyes were hit by this weapon which hurt alot. Now during his time as Parashurama The Chakratazhwar Chakra was in his parashu(axe) used to kill kstraiyas. During his Ramam Avatar only one person saw Rama in his Chakratazhwar form. This person was Hanuman. When Rama and Lakshmana travelled to Sugreeva's kingdom. Sugreeva thought that his brother Vali sent these man as if Vali entered his kingdom he would die. To verify this doubt Sugreeva sent Hanuman to check these two man out. When Hanuman saw Rama. He described Rama with the sanskrit word "bahava". This word means hand in english. Now I know what you're thinking why is Hanuman being described as hand. Well we need to understand what this means exactly. You see "bahu" means one hand "bahuu" means two hands but, "bahava" means three or more hands. Now Rama was an incarnation of Vishnu, and we know Vishnu has four hands. So this means that Hanuman saw Rama as Lord Vishnu in his multi armed f0rm. Now Vishnu holds the Sudarhsana Chakram in his hand which meant that Lord Hanuman saw Chakratazwhar and thats how he appeared during Rama's incarnation. Now in Dwapara Yuga Chakratazwhar was in Balarama's plough and Krishna had used to almost attack and kill Bhisma during the Kurkshertra War on the third day. Now In kalki avataram the Chakratazhwar Chakram nor any of Vishnu's waepons because he isn't even born yet as he will be brought into this world during the end of Kali yuga so not in another 426,875 years. This is when and wear Chakratazwhar has appeared throught out the 4 yugas in the Dasavatharam. </p>
