In Hinduism Vishnu possesses four symbols on his four hands.They are the discus Sudarshana Chakra, the bow Sharanga, the mace Kaumodaki, the conch Panchajanya, and the sword Nandaka. His most powerful and recognisable weapons is the Sudarshana Chakaram. However, in actuality this chakram is Chakrathazhwar, also known as Sudarshana Perumal. He emerges as the divine embodiment of Vishnu's most potent weapon the sudarshana chakra, signifying the guide to enlightenment. Found in dedicated shrines across Vishnu-associated temples, Chakrathazhwar is believed to embody the combined grace of Varaha and Narasimha. Chakrathazhwar is one among the nithya sooriyas who perform kainkaryam to the divya dampathis for eternity. Chakratazhwar has appeared countless times throughout the four yugas. During Krita Yuga he appeared five times with Vishnu's four avatars Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Narashima.With Matsya he appeared in Matsya's Horn which aided in pulling the ship created by Sage Vaivasvata Manu when pralayam occured. When Vishnu incarnated as Kurma Avatar Chakrathazhwar appears two times. The first time was during the churning of the ocean. When the Asuras and Devas were churning the ocean with the mountain. Vishnu became the Kurma Avatar to stabilize the mountain for proper churning. However, it doesn't have Chakrathazhwar as the Sudarshana Chakra was above kurma Avatar oscillating left and right like a cast cutter. Due to this constant left and right motion The Churning was easier for The Asuras and Devas to conduct. After the churning was over, The Amrutha(Nectar) of Immortality was finally made, but there was a problem. The Asuras wanted this Amrutha(Nectar) all to themselves to overthrow the Devas. Therefore Vishnu(still a-s Kurma) became Mohini avatar and started to give out the Amrutha(Nectar) to the devas who were silently devoted themselves to Vishnu and manipulated the Asuras that Vishnu will give it, but in actuality wasn't. One of the Asuras, Swarbhanu , disguised himself as a deva. The Devas surrounding Svarbhanu discovered this and informed this to Lord Vishnu. However, Svarbhanu had already drunk the amrutham making him immortal. Therefore Vishnu(as Mohini) cut Svarbhanu's head with his Sudarshana Chakra. Later Svarbhanu's head was referred to as Rahu whilst his body was referred to as Ketu. When Vishnu became Varaha He  When Vishnu became Narashima Chakratazwar was in his claws. There is a shlokam called Nagagre Chakali Chakre Yastam Veeram Yama yaham which talks about how his claws were where the sudarshana chakram   was. This is because these were the same claws used to kill Hiranyakashipu. In Treta Yuga There were three instances where Chakratazhwar appeared. With Vamana, Parashurama and Rama. Vamana while visiting King Bali(The Grandson of Prahalda) who was doing Aachamanam asked for three pieces of land. While Hearing this King Bali was attempting to pour water from his patram but not matter what he did the water was blocked. What happened was Shukracharya shrunk to block the spout of the patram because he early had warned King Bali about How Vamana posed a threat to him and his kingdom. In effort to stop him from continuing his pooja Shukracharya blocked the spout. However, Vamana said that something was blocking the spout and used his Dharba to push into the spout to get Shukracharya out of there. In this instance the Sudarshana Chakra was at the tip of the Dharba and it was the Sudarshan Chakram that pierced Shukracharya eye. This is when Chakaratazhwar appeared. Now during his time as Parashurama The Sudarshana Chakra was in his parashu(ax) used to kill kshatriyas. During his Ramam Avatar only one person saw Rama in his Chakrathazhwar form. This person was Hanuman. Rama and Lakshmana traveled to Sugreeva's kingdom. Sugreeva thought that his brother Vali sent these man as if Vali entered his kingdom he would die. To verify this doubt Sugreeva sent Hanuman to check these two man out. When Hanuman saw Rama. He described Rama with the sanskrit word "bahavaha ". This word means hand in english. Now I know what you are thinking why did Hanuman describe Rama with the word hand. Well we need to understand what this means exactly. You see, "bahu" means one hand, "bahuu" means two hands, but "bahava" means three or more hands. Now Rama was an incarnation of Vishnu, and we know Vishnu has four hands. So this means that Hanuman saw Rama as Lord Vishnu in his multi armed f0rm. Now Vishnu holds the Sudarshana Chakra in his hand which means that Lord Hanuman saw Chakrathazhwar and that's how he appeared during Rama's incarnation. Now in Dwapara Yuga Chakrathazhwar was in Balarama's plough, but with Lord Krishna There were two times he showed Chakrathazhwar. The First time was when we has born when Vishnu incarnated as Lord Krishna In Devaki and Vasudeva.  There is a funny story on when Chakratazwhar appeared. You See Back In India there was a fun game kids used to play called puchi kattu velaiyattu. Which was their version of peekaboo. Now while playing Peekaboo you say Peekaboo but with Puchi kattu Vilayattu you say puchi. Now while playing Pucchi with friends, he had shown his multi armed form to them and quickly hid it saying Puchi. That's when he showed chakrathazhwar.
